## Parallel Development Opportunities

### Weeks 1-6: Single Unit Focus
```
Week 1-6: Unit 1 (Data Processing) - Solo development
         Infrastructure setup in parallel
```

### Weeks 6-12: Two Units in Parallel
```
Week 6-12: Unit 1 (Data Processing) - Completion phase
          Unit 2 (Portfolio Monitoring) - Full development
```

### Weeks 8-14: Three Units in Parallel
```
Week 8-14: Unit 1 (Data Processing) - Testing & refinement
          Unit 2 (Portfolio Monitoring) - Completion phase
          Unit 3 (Risk Integration) - Full development
```

### Weeks 12-18: Four Units Active
```
Week 12-18: Unit 2 (Portfolio Monitoring) - Production ready
           Unit 3 (Risk Integration) - Completion phase
           Unit 4 (Core Analytics) - Full development
```

### Weeks 16-20: All Units Active
```
Week 16-20: Unit 3 (Risk Integration) - Production ready
           Unit 4 (Core Analytics) - Completion phase
           Unit 5 (Interactive Features) - Full development
```

## Integration Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Foundation (Week 8)
**Criteria:**
- Unit 1 successfully processes CSV files
- ESG scores calculated and published to message queue
- Basic data validation working
- Message queue infrastructure operational

**Validation:**
- End-to-end test: CSV file → ESG scores → message queue
- Performance test: 1000 holdings processed in <2 minutes
- Integration test: Other units can consume ESG data events

### Milestone 2: Business Logic Integration (Week 14)
**Criteria:**
- Unit 2 monitors thresholds and sends email alerts
- Unit 3 calculates ESG-adjusted risk scores
- Both units consume Unit 1 data successfully
- Cross-unit message flow working

**Validation:**
- End-to-end test: CSV file → ESG scores → threshold alerts
- End-to-end test: CSV file → ESG scores → risk adjustments
- Integration test: Email notifications sent for threshold breaches

### Milestone 3: User Interface Integration (Week 18)
**Criteria:**
- Unit 4 displays dashboards with data from Units 1, 2, 3
- Role-based dashboards functional
- Basic visualizations working
- System configuration management operational

**Validation:**
- End-to-end test: CSV file → ESG scores → dashboard display
- User acceptance test: Portfolio managers can view ESG data
- Performance test: Dashboard loads in <3 seconds

### Milestone 4: Full Platform Integration (Week 20)
**Criteria:**
- Unit 5 provides interactive features on Unit 4 dashboards
- Real-time updates working
- Data export functionality operational
- All units integrated and tested

**Validation:**
- End-to-end test: Complete user workflow from data to interaction
- Performance test: 50 concurrent users supported
- User acceptance test: All user personas can complete their tasks

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Dependency Risk Management
- **Mock Services**: Each unit develops with mocked dependencies
- **Contract Testing**: Validate message contracts between units
- **Incremental Integration**: Integrate one unit at a time
- **Rollback Plans**: Ability to revert to previous stable versions

### Resource Allocation Risks
- **Cross-Training**: Team members familiar with multiple units
- **Flexible Staffing**: Ability to move developers between units
- **Buffer Time**: 20% buffer built into each unit timeline
- **Critical Path Monitoring**: Daily tracking of Unit 1 progress

### Technical Integration Risks
- **Early Integration**: Start integration testing in Week 4
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing of unit interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Early identification of bottlenecks
- **Scalability Testing**: Load testing at each milestone

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Unit 1**: 100% completion by Week 8 (critical path)
- **Units 2-3**: 90% completion by Week 14
- **Unit 4**: 90% completion by Week 18
- **Unit 5**: 100% completion by Week 20

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: >80% for each unit
- **Integration Test Pass Rate**: >95%
- **Performance SLA Achievement**: 100% of defined SLAs met
- **User Acceptance**: >90% satisfaction score

### Business Value Delivery
- **Week 8**: ESG score calculations available
- **Week 14**: Portfolio monitoring and risk integration operational
- **Week 18**: Basic dashboards providing business value
- **Week 20**: Full interactive platform delivered

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Unit 1 immediately** - Critical path dependency
2. **Establish message queue infrastructure early** - Required for all integration
3. **Begin Unit 2 in Week 6** - Optimal balance of dependency and parallelism
4. **Maintain 2-week buffer between dependent units** - Allows for integration issues
5. **Focus on Milestone 1 achievement** - Foundation for all subsequent development
6. **Plan for 20% timeline buffer** - Account for integration complexity
7. **Implement continuous integration from Week 4** - Early detection of issues
