# Unit 1: Data Processing and ESG Scoring

## Unit Overview
This unit is responsible for the core data pipeline that ingests, validates, and processes ESG data to calculate sustainability scores. It serves as the foundational data layer for the entire ESG platform.

## Business Capability
- ESG data ingestion from CSV files
- Data validation and quality assurance
- ESG score calculation using standardized methodology
- File location configuration management

## User Stories

### US-001: CSV Data Ingestion
**As an** ESG Analyst  
**I want** the system to automatically ingest ESG data from standardized CSV files  
**So that** I can process sustainability metrics without manual data entry

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System reads CSV files from pre-configured file locations
- Validates CSV format and required columns (Environmental, Social, Governance metrics)
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully with error logging
- Processes multiple portfolio holdings in batch

### US-002: ESG Score Calculation
**As a** Strategist  
**I want** the system to calculate composite ESG scores using fixed weightings  
**So that** I can rank investments based on standardized sustainability metrics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Applies fixed weighting: 40% Environmental, 30% Social, 30% Governance
- Calculates scores for individual holdings and portfolio aggregates
- Normalizes scores to 0-100 scale
- Stores calculated scores with timestamp

### US-003: Data Validation and Quality Checks
**As an** ESG Analyst  
**I want** the system to validate data quality and completeness  
**So that** I can trust the accuracy of ESG calculations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Validates data ranges and formats for each ESG metric
- Identifies and flags incomplete or suspicious data points
- Provides data quality reports with validation results
- Prevents processing of invalid datasets

### US-020: File Location Configuration
**As a** System Administrator  
**I want** to configure CSV file input locations  
**So that** the system can automatically process ESG data from designated sources

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Defines file paths for CSV data ingestion
- Supports multiple input directories for different data sources
- Validates file path accessibility and permissions
- Monitors configured locations for new data files

## Unit Boundaries and Responsibilities

### What This Unit Owns
- CSV file processing and parsing
- ESG score calculation algorithms
- Data validation rules and quality checks
- File location configuration management
- Raw and processed ESG data storage

### What This Unit Does NOT Own
- Portfolio monitoring and alerting logic
- Risk adjustment calculations
- User interface and visualization
- Email notification systems

## Integration Points

### Outbound Messages (Published Events)
- **ESGDataProcessed**: Published when new ESG scores are calculated
  - Payload: Portfolio ID, Holdings with ESG scores, Processing timestamp
- **DataValidationFailed**: Published when data quality issues are detected
  - Payload: File name, Validation errors, Failed records count
- **FileProcessingCompleted**: Published when CSV file processing finishes
  - Payload: File name, Records processed, Success/failure status

### Inbound Messages (Subscribed Events)
- **ConfigurationUpdated**: Receives file location configuration changes
  - Payload: New file paths, Configuration version

### Shared Data Models
- **ESGHolding**: Individual holding with E, S, G component scores and composite score
- **Portfolio**: Collection of holdings with aggregate ESG metrics
- **DataQualityReport**: Validation results and quality metrics

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage
- In-memory repositories for MVP
- Configurable data retention policies
- Audit trail for score calculations

### Performance Requirements
- Process up to 1000 holdings per batch within 2 minutes
- Support multiple concurrent file processing
- Handle files up to 10MB in size

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of malformed CSV files
- Retry mechanism for transient failures
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting

## Dependencies
- **External**: File system access for CSV files
- **Internal**: Configuration service for file locations and processing parameters

## Success Criteria
- Successfully processes 99.9% of valid CSV files
- ESG score calculations complete within 30 seconds for typical portfolios
- Data validation catches 100% of format and range errors
- Zero data loss during processing
