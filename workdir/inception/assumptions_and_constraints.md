# Assumptions and Constraints

## Key Assumptions
1. **Data Format**: ESG data will be provided in standardized CSV formats with consistent column structures
2. **Data Sources**: CSV files will be available at pre-configured file locations accessible by the system
3. **Scoring Methodology**: Fixed ESG weighting (40% Environmental, 30% Social, 30% Governance) is acceptable for all use cases
4. **User Access**: Role-based access control is handled externally to the platform
5. **Infrastructure**: Basic email infrastructure (SMTP) is available for notifications
6. **Data Quality**: Input data quality is generally reliable with occasional missing or invalid values
7. **Performance**: System will handle typical portfolio sizes (hundreds to thousands of holdings)
8. **Availability**: Standard business hours availability is sufficient for MVP

## Technical Constraints
1. **MVP Scope**: Limited to core functionality only, excluding advanced features
2. **Integration**: No sophisticated external system integrations required
3. **Audit Trail**: No comprehensive audit logging required for MVP
4. **Historical Data**: No requirement for extensive historical data tracking
5. **Real-time Processing**: Near real-time processing acceptable (within 15 minutes for alerts)
6. **Scalability**: System designed for single organization use, not multi-tenant

## Business Constraints
1. **Timeline**: Accelerated development timeline requires focused scope
2. **Resources**: Limited development team size
3. **Budget**: Cost-effective solution prioritizing essential functionality
4. **Compliance**: No regulatory compliance automation required for MVP
5. **Reporting**: Basic dashboard reporting sufficient, no formal report generation

## Data Constraints
1. **Storage**: In-memory repositories acceptable for MVP
2. **Backup**: Basic configuration backup required
3. **Security**: Standard data protection measures sufficient
4. **Volume**: Moderate data volumes expected (not big data scale)
5. **Frequency**: Daily or batch processing acceptable, no real-time streaming required
