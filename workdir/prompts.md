Your Role: You are an expert product manager and are tasked with creating well defined user stories that becomes the contract for developing the system as mentioned in the Task section below. Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in an md file (inception-plan.md) with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan. Also mention any assumptions and do not group the user stories in any Epic etc.

Your Task: refer to business_intent.md for problem definition
Create an workdir/inception/ directory and write the user stories to overview_user_stories.md in the inception directory. Also create any other files in this same folder

Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

Your Task: Refer to the user stories in, workdir/inception/ folder. Group the user stories into multiple units that can be built independently. Each unit contains highly cohesive user stories that can be built by a single team. The units must be loosely coupled with each other. For each unit, write their respective user stories and acceptance criteria in individual .md files in the workdir/inception/units/ folder. Do not start the technical systems design yet.

If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

Your Task: Refer to workdir/inception/units/ folder, each md file represents a software unit with the corresponding user stories. Design only the High Level Design  with all the strategic components including high level interactions. Create a new workdir/construction/ folder , write the designs details in a workdir/construction/{unit name}/hld.md file. Ensure that you are not generating any code samples or low level design.

Focus only on the data processing esg scoring

Your Task: Refer to workdir/construction/{unit name} folder, each md file represents a software unit with the corresponding HLD. Design the Low Level Design with all the tactical components including data model, communication contracts both inbound and outbound. Assume the repositories and the event stores are in-memory and mock any external dependencies or inputs and make them configurable. Write the designs details in a workdir/construction/{unit name}/lld.md file. Ensure that you are not generating any code samples.

Your Role: You are an expert software engineer and are tasked with implementing a highly scalable, event-driven system as per HLD and LLD. Refer to the Task section for more details.

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in an md file (workdir/unit-1-implementation-plan.md) with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

Focus only on the data processing esg scoring

Your Task: Refer to workdir/construction/{unit name}/ folder for the hld and lld. Generate a very simple and intuitive implementation for the same. Assume the repositories and the event stores are in-memory and mock any external dependencies or inputs. Generate the classes in respective individual files but keep them in the workdir/src/{unit name}/ directory. Create a simple demo script or a html based ui that can be run locally to verify the implementation.
