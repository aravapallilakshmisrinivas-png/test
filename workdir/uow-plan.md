# Unit of Work Plan - ESG Data Platform

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to group the 20 user stories into independent, loosely coupled units that can be built by separate development teams. Each unit will contain highly cohesive user stories that form a logical boundary for development and deployment.

## Assumptions
- Each unit should be independently deployable and testable
- Units communicate through well-defined interfaces (events, APIs, shared data)
- Teams can work in parallel with minimal dependencies
- Each unit serves a specific business capability
- Units should follow domain-driven design principles

## Plan Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Unit Identification
- [x] **Step 1: Analyze User Story Dependencies**
  - Map data flow between user stories
  - Identify shared data entities and business processes
  - Document integration points and communication needs
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 2: Identify Natural Unit Boundaries**
  - Group stories by business capability and data ownership
  - Ensure high cohesion within units and loose coupling between units
  - Validate that each unit can be built by a single team (5-7 developers)
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 3: Create Units Directory Structure**
  - Create `workdir/inception/units/` directory
  - Prepare file structure for individual unit documentation
  - *Status: Completed*

### Phase 2: Unit Definition and Validation
- [x] **Step 4: Define Unit 1 - Data Processing and ESG Scoring**
  - Include: US-001, US-002, US-003, US-020 (Core data ingestion, calculation, and file config)
  - Rationale: Foundational data processing capabilities
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 5: Define Unit 2 - Portfolio Monitoring and Alerting**
  - Include: US-004, US-005, US-006, US-018 (Monitoring, analytics, notifications, threshold config)
  - Rationale: Portfolio management and alerting capabilities
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 6: Define Unit 3 - Risk Integration**
  - Include: US-007, US-008, US-009 (ESG-adjusted risk calculations)
  - Rationale: Specialized risk assessment functionality
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 7: Define Unit 4 - Core Analytics and Dashboards**
  - Include: US-010, US-011, US-012, US-013, US-019 (Basic dashboards, visualizations, system config)
  - Rationale: Fundamental dashboard and visualization capabilities
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 8: Define Unit 5 - Interactive Dashboard Features**
  - Include: US-014, US-015, US-016, US-017 (Advanced interactive capabilities)
  - Rationale: Enhanced user experience and dashboard interactivity
  - *Status: Completed*

### Phase 3: Unit Documentation Creation
- [x] **Step 9: Create Unit 1 Documentation**
  - Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Define unit boundaries and responsibilities
  - Document integration points with other units
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 10: Create Unit 2 Documentation**
  - Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Define unit boundaries and responsibilities
  - Document integration points with other units
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 11: Create Unit 3 Documentation**
  - Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Define unit boundaries and responsibilities
  - Document integration points with other units
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 12: Create Unit 4 Documentation**
  - Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Define unit boundaries and responsibilities
  - Document integration points with other units
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 13: Create Unit 5 Documentation**
  - Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Define unit boundaries and responsibilities
  - Document integration points with other units
  - *Status: Completed*

### Phase 4: Validation and Integration Analysis
- [x] **Step 14: Validate Unit Independence**
  - Ensure each unit can be developed and tested independently
  - Verify minimal dependencies between units
  - Confirm each unit delivers business value on its own
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 15: Document Inter-Unit Integration**
  - Define data contracts between units
  - Specify event-driven communication patterns
  - Document shared data models and APIs
  - *Status: Completed*

- [x] **Step 16: Create Unit Development Sequencing**
  - Recommend optimal development order based on dependencies
  - Identify which units can be developed in parallel
  - Define integration milestones and testing strategies
  - *Status: Completed*

## Critical Decision Points Requiring Confirmation
1. **Unit Granularity**: Should we create 5 units as proposed, or would you prefer a different grouping (e.g., 3 larger units or 7 smaller units)? [Answer: I am fine with the grouping]
2. **Configuration Unit**: Should system configuration be a separate unit, or distributed across other units? [Answer: Distribute other units]
3. **Analytics Scope**: Should the analytics unit include both basic and interactive dashboard features, or split them?[Answer:my thought is to split but suggest me which is best]
4. **Integration Strategy**: Should units communicate via events, direct API calls, or shared database? [Answer: message queue based ]

## Final Unit Structure (Based on Feedback)
1. **Data Processing & ESG Scoring Unit** (3 stories + config) - Core data pipeline with file configuration
2. **Portfolio Monitoring & Alerting Unit** (3 stories + config) - Business monitoring with threshold configuration
3. **Risk Integration Unit** (3 stories) - Specialized risk calculations
4. **Core Analytics & Dashboards Unit** (4 stories + config) - Basic dashboard functionality with system parameters
5. **Interactive Dashboard Features Unit** (4 stories) - Advanced interactive features

**Configuration Distribution:**
- US-020 (File Location Config) → Unit 1 (Data Processing)
- US-018 (Threshold Management) → Unit 2 (Portfolio Monitoring)
- US-019 (System Parameters) → Unit 4 (Core Analytics)

**Communication:** Message queue-based integration between units

## Next Steps
Upon your review and approval of this plan, I will execute each step systematically, marking checkboxes as completed and creating the individual unit documentation files.
