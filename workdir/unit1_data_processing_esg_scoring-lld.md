# Low Level Design Plan - Unit 1: Data Processing & ESG Scoring

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create a comprehensive Low Level Design (LLD) for Unit 1: Data Processing & ESG Scoring. The LLD will define tactical components, detailed data models, communication contracts, and implementation specifications based on the existing HLD.

## Assumptions
- Repositories and data stores are in-memory (HashMap-based for MVP)
- External dependencies (file system, database) are mocked and configurable
- Database integration follows the updated architecture (no message queue)

## Critical Decision Points Requiring Confirmation
1. **In-Memory Storage Strategy**: Should we use ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety or implement custom locking mechanisms?[Answer: which ever is best and eassy]
2. **File Processing Approach**: Should we process files sequentially or implement parallel processing with configurable thread pools?[answer: Parralel]
3. **Database Mock Strategy**: Should we use embedded H2 database for testing or pure in-memory HashMap structures?[Answer: which ever is best and eassy]
4. **Configuration Hot-Reload**: Should configuration changes trigger immediate reprocessing of queued files or only affect new files? [Answer: new files only]
5. **Error Recovery Strategy**: Should failed file processing be retried automatically or require manual intervention? [Answer: automatic]

## Success Criteria
- All 8 strategic components have detailed tactical specifications
- Complete data models with validation rules and constraints
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Configurable mock implementations for all external dependencies
- Performance and security considerations fully addressed
- Ready for implementation by development teams

## Next Steps
Upon your review and approval of this plan, I will execute each step systematically, marking checkboxes as completed and creating the comprehensive LLD documentation in the workdir/construction/unit1_data_processing_esg_scoring/lld.md file.
