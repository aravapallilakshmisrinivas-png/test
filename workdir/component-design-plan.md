# Component Design Plan - ESG Data Platform High Level Design

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create high-level component designs for all 5 units of the ESG Data Platform. Each unit will have strategic components defined with their interactions, responsibilities, and integration points without diving into low-level implementation details.

## Assumptions

- No code samples or low-level design details
- Message queue-based communication between units
- In-memory repositories for MVP scope
- Each unit is independently deployable and scalable

  - Consolidate key architectural decisions
  - Document component interaction patterns
  - Summarize technology choices and rationale
  - Provide implementation guidance for development teams
  - *Status: Pending*

## Critical Decision Points Requiring Confirmation
1. **Component Granularity**: Should we design fine-grained components or coarser-grained services within each unit? [Answer: Fine grained]
2. **State Management**: How should we handle stateful components vs stateless components in the design? [Answer: I am not technically so good to answer this, please pick best one ]
3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Should error handling be centralized or distributed across components? [Answer: Centralized]
4. **Caching Strategy**: Should we include caching components in the HLD or treat as implementation detail? [Answer: in HLD]
5. **Security Components**: Should authentication/authorization be designed as separate components or cross-cutting concerns? [Answer: Seperate Component]

## Design Standards
- Each HLD will include: Component diagram, responsibility matrix, interaction flows, and integration points
- Components will be described at strategic level without implementation details
- Focus on business capabilities and technical responsibilities
- Clear separation of concerns and single responsibility principle
- Event-driven architecture patterns throughout

## Success Criteria
- All 5 units have comprehensive HLD documentation
- Component interactions clearly defined and consistent
- Message contracts specified between units
- Design supports independent development and deployment
- Architecture enables scalability and maintainability

## Next Steps
Upon your review and approval of this plan, I will execute each step systematically, marking checkboxes as completed and creating the HLD documentation for each unit.
