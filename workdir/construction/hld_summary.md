# High Level Design Summary - ESG Data Platform

## Architectural Overview
The ESG Data Platform is designed as a distributed system with 5 independent units communicating via shared database. Each unit contains fine-grained components following single responsibility principle.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Database-Driven Architecture
- **Shared Database**: PostgreSQL for inter-unit communication
- **Polling-Based Processing**: Units poll for data changes
- **Data Persistence**: Audit trail through database records

### 2. Hybrid State Management
- **Stateless Components**: Processing, calculation, validation (scalable)
- **Stateful Components**: Caching, session management, connections (performance)

### 3. Centralized Error Handling
- **Error Aggregation**: Per-unit error handling components
- **Standardized Contracts**: Consistent error reporting
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures

### 4. Separate Security Components
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based identity verification
- **Authorization Service**: RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive security event tracking

### 5. Caching Strategy in HLD
- **Application Cache**: Frequently accessed ESG scores
- **Session Cache**: User preferences and filter states
- **Configuration Cache**: System parameters and thresholds

## Unit Component Summary

### Unit 1: Data Processing & ESG Scoring (8 Components)
- File Monitor, CSV Ingestion Engine, Data Validator Framework
- ESG Calculation Engine, Configuration Manager, Score Storage Repository
- Event Publisher, Error Handler

### Unit 2: Portfolio Monitoring & Alerting (9 Components)  
- Event Consumer, Threshold Monitoring Engine, Alert Generator
- Email Notification Service, Template Engine, Portfolio Analytics Calculator
- Threshold Configuration Manager, Analytics Storage, Data Cache Manager

### Unit 3: Risk Integration (10 Components)
- Event Consumer, External Risk Data Adapter, Risk Data Aggregator
- Risk Score Calculator, Linear Adjustment Model Engine, Adjustment Parameter Manager
- Risk Assessment Integrator, Risk Comparison Generator, Calculation Auditor, Risk Storage

### Unit 4: Core Analytics & Dashboards (12 Components)
- Authentication, Authorization, Dashboard Engine, Visualization Generator
- Data Aggregation Service, Sector Analysis Engine, Role-Based Access Controller
- Drill-Down Navigation Manager, System Configuration Manager, Event Consumer, Data Cache, Session Manager

### Unit 5: Interactive Dashboard Features (8 Components)
- Interactive Filter Engine, Filter State Manager, Data Export Manager
- Real-Time Update Handler, Chart Interaction Controller, WebSocket Manager
- Session State Persistence, Event Consumer

## Integration Patterns

### Data Flow
```
Unit 1 → esg_holdings table → Units 2,3,4,5 (polling)
Unit 2 → portfolio_analytics table → Units 4,5 (polling)
Unit 3 → risk_assessments table → Units 4,5 (polling)
Unit 4 → dashboard_views table → Unit 5 (polling)
```

### Shared Components
- Common data models (ESGHolding, Portfolio, etc.)
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, security)
- Configuration management and caching strategies

## Performance Characteristics
- **Unit 1**: 1000 holdings in 2 minutes
- **Unit 2**: 30-second threshold evaluation, 15-minute email SLA
- **Unit 3**: 1-minute risk calculations for 1000 holdings
- **Unit 4**: 3-second dashboard load, 50 concurrent users
- **Unit 5**: 2-second filter response, 30-second real-time updates

## Technology Alignment
- **Backend**: Java/Spring Boot with fine-grained components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for shared data storage
- **Frontend**: React.js with component-based architecture
- **Security**: JWT authentication with RBAC authorization
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards

This HLD provides the strategic foundation for implementing a scalable, maintainable ESG data platform with clear component boundaries and robust integration patterns.
