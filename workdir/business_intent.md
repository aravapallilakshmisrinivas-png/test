The organization will develop a focused ESG data platform that establishes core functionality for sustainability metrics analysis w
This initiative will establish a centralized system for analyzing environmental, social, and governance data across investment portfolios, implementing standardized ESG scoring methodologies, basic portfolio monitoring with threshold-based alerting, simple risk integration capabilities, and essential dashboard analytics.
Normalized, structured ESG data will be provided in standardized CSV formats from pre-configured file locations, allowing focus on core analytics and insights generation rather than complex data ingestion and normalization challenges.
The platform will focus on current-state reporting and analysis, implementing a single, transparent methodology for calculating Environmental, Social, and Governance scores across all portfolio holdings using fixed weightings (40% Environmental, 30% Social, 30% Governance). Basic portfolio analytics will provide fundamental ESG performance monitoring through dashboard visualizations, with threshold-based alerting capabilities using pre-configured values in system configuration files rather than user-configurable interfaces.
Simple risk integration will enable basic ESG-adjusted credit risk calculations using linear adjustment models applied uniformly across all sectors, while essential user experience will deliver role-based dashboards for portfolio analysis with basic visualizations and drill-down capabilities. The system will support simple email notifications only for threshold breaches, with no audit trail requirements, historical change tracking, or comprehensive logging capabilities for the MVP phase.
To ensure rapid delivery, the following capabilities are excluded from MVP scope: predictive analytics and trend forecasting, regulatory compliance automation, sophisticated integrations with external systems, API access capabilities, comprehensive data lineage tracking, dynamic data source configuration, advanced alerting with configurable rules and notification history, executive reporting and formal report generation, audit and governance features including comprehensive audit trails and change tracking, and advanced risk analytics with sophisticated ESG-credit correlation models.
this will establish a robust foundation for future platform evolution toward the comprehensive long-term vision while delivering core ESG intelligence functionality within accelerated development timelines, enabling portfolio managers to monitor sustainability risks, ESG analysts to understand scoring methodologies and peer benchmarking, strategists to generate composite ESG scores for investment ranking, credit risk officers to incorporate sustainability factors into risk assessments, and portfolio analysts to view sector-level ESG performance through intuitive dashboard interfaces.
