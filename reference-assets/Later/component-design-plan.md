## Key Considerations Requiring Clarification

### **Step 1.2 - Domain Boundary Analysis**
- **Question 1**: Should we treat each unit as a separate bounded context, or are there shared contexts across units?
  - **Option A**: Each unit = separate bounded context with anti-corruption layers
  - **Option B**: Some units share bounded contexts (e.g., ESG scoring concepts)
  - **Need confirmation on bounded context strategy**
  [Answer: Option A]

### **Step 2.1 - Aggregate Design Strategy**
- **Question 2**: What level of granularity should we use for aggregate design?
  - **Option A**: Fine-grained aggregates for maximum flexibility
  - **Option B**: Coarse-grained aggregates for consistency and performance
  - **Need confirmation on aggregate granularity preference**
  [Answer: Option B]

### **Step 7.2 - Anti-Corruption Layer Complexity**
- **Question 3**: How detailed should the anti-corruption layer specifications be?
  - **Option A**: High-level conceptual mapping between contexts
  - **Option B**: Detailed transformation specifications and adapters
  - **Need confirmation on ACL documentation depth**
  [Answer: Option B]

### **Domain Event Strategy**
- **Question 4**: Should domain events be designed for eventual consistency across units or just within unit boundaries?
  - **Option A**: Events only within bounded contexts
  - **Option B**: Cross-unit integration events for eventual consistency
  - **Need confirmation on event scope and integration strategy**
  [Answer: Option B]

## Domain Modeling Standards

### DDD Tactical Patterns to Include
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries and transaction scopes
- **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity
- **Domain Events**: Significant business occurrences
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities
- **Repositories**: Data access abstractions
- **Policies**: Business rules and constraints
- **Factories**: Complex object creation logic

### Documentation Structure per Unit

## Success Criteria

### Domain Model Completeness
- [ ] All user stories mapped to domain behaviors
- [ ] All business rules captured in domain policies
- [ ] All data consistency requirements addressed through aggregates
- [ ] All significant business events identified as domain events
- [ ] All complex business logic encapsulated in domain services

### DDD Best Practices Compliance
- [ ] Aggregates maintain consistency boundaries
- [ ] Entities have clear identity and lifecycle management
- [ ] Value objects are immutable and behavior-rich
- [ ] Domain events represent meaningful business occurrences
- [ ] Domain services contain stateless business logic
- [ ] Repositories provide clean data access abstractions

### Cross-Unit Integration
- [ ] Bounded context boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] Anti-corruption layers specified for unit interactions
- [ ] Shared kernel concepts identified and documented
- [ ] Published language defined for cross-unit communication
- [ ] Integration events designed for eventual consistency

## Risk Mitigation

### Domain Complexity Management
- **Risk**: Over-complex domain models that are difficult to implement
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple models and evolve based on business needs

### Bounded Context Boundaries
- **Risk**: Incorrect bounded context boundaries leading to tight coupling
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of business capabilities and team structures

### Cross-Unit Consistency
- **Risk**: Inconsistent domain concepts across units
- **Mitigation**: Define shared kernel and published language clearly

### Performance Considerations
- **Risk**: Domain model design that doesn't support performance requirements
- **Mitigation**: Consider aggregate size and event processing patterns
