- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with clear bounded contexts
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters for external integrations

### Implementation Standards Following Global Best Practices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes and RFC 7807

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and OpenAPI specifications
- **Configuration**: 12-Factor App methodology with environment-based configuration
- **Security**: Security by design with OWASP guidelines and zero-trust principles
- **Performance**: Performance-first design with profiling and optimization

## Configuration Management Strategy

### Environment-Based Configuration
- **Development**: Local in-memory storage with mock services
- **Testing**: Test containers with isolated test data
- **Staging**: Production-like environment with real integrations
- **Production**: Scalable infrastructure with external services

### Configurable Components
