# ESG Platform - Component Design Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the High Level Design (HLD) creation for all 5 units of the ESG Data Platform. Each unit will have its strategic components, interactions, and architectural decisions documented without diving into implementation details or code samples.

### Phase 5: Unit 3 - Risk Integration Module
- [x] **Step 5.1**: Design Unit 3 High Level Architecture
  - Define ESG-risk integration strategic components
  - Design linear adjustment model implementation architecture
  - Plan risk factor analysis and decomposition framework
  - Design risk monitoring and alerting integration

- [x] **Step 5.2**: Create Unit 3 HLD Document
  - Write `/construction/unit3_risk_integration/hld.md`
  - Include risk calculation engine architecture
  - Define risk methodology and transparency components
  - Document integration strategy with other units

### Phase 6: Unit 4 - Analytics & Visualization Platform
- [x] **Step 6.1**: Design Unit 4 High Level Architecture
  - Define frontend application strategic components
  - Design role-based dashboard architecture
  - Plan visualization engine and chart generation framework
  - Design data aggregation and export system architecture

- [x] **Step 6.2**: Create Unit 4 HLD Document
  - Write `/construction/unit4_analytics_visualization/hld.md`
  - Include user interface architecture and component structure
  - Define visualization and dashboard framework
  - Document user experience and accessibility strategy

### Phase 7: Cross-Unit Integration and Validation
- [x] **Step 7.1**: Review inter-unit architectural consistency
  - Validate API contract alignment across all units
  - Ensure architectural patterns are consistent
  - Review data flow and integration points

- [x] **Step 7.2**: Create system-wide architectural overview
  - Document overall system architecture showing unit interactions
  - Create high-level deployment architecture
  - Define system-wide quality attributes and constraints

### Phase 8: Documentation Review and Finalization
- [x] **Step 8.1**: Review all HLD documents for completeness
  - Ensure all strategic components are documented
  - Validate architectural decisions are justified
  - Check consistency across all unit designs
  - Verify no implementation details or code samples are included

- [x] **Step 8.2**: Final validation and approval preparation
  - Cross-reference HLD content with user stories
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are architecturally addressed
  - Prepare summary of key architectural decisions
  - Document any assumptions or constraints identified during design

## Key Architectural Principles to Follow

### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each unit has clear, distinct responsibilities
- **Loose Coupling**: Units interact through well-defined APIs only
- **High Cohesion**: Components within each unit work together toward unit objectives
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports independent scaling of units
- **Maintainability**: Clear component boundaries enable independent maintenance

### Documentation Standards
- **Strategic Focus**: Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- **Component-Level**: Document major components and their interactions
- **Decision Rationale**: Include reasoning behind architectural choices
- **No Implementation**: Avoid code samples, specific technologies, or detailed designs
- **Visual Aids**: Include conceptual diagrams where helpful for understanding

## Clarifications Received

Based on your guidance:
- **API Specifications**: Keep conceptual, avoid detailed endpoint specifications
- **Technology Neutrality**: Avoid specific technologies, finalize during LLD phase
- **Integration Architecture**: Create separate system-wide integration architecture document
- **Deployment Architecture**: Exclude from HLD documents
- **Quality Attributes**: Summarize at high level only

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 5 units have comprehensive HLD documents created
- [x] Each HLD focuses on strategic components and high-level interactions
- [x] No implementation details or code samples are included
- [x] Architectural decisions are documented with rationale
- [x] Inter-unit dependencies and interfaces are clearly defined
- [x] System-wide integration architecture document created
- [x] Documents are ready for development team handoff

## Execution Status
âœ… **HLD Plan execution completed successfully!** All phases have been executed and documented. The comprehensive High Level Design for all 5 units of the ESG Data Platform is complete and ready for Low Level Design phase.
