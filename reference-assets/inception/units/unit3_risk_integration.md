## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Linear adjustment model calculation testing
- Risk factor decomposition algorithm testing
- Risk threshold evaluation logic testing
- Risk alert generation testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end ESG risk integration workflow
- API integration with Unit 1 for ESG scores
- Risk calculation accuracy validation
- Alert integration with notification system

### Mock Dependencies
- **Unit 1 ESG Scores**: Mock ESG score data with various risk scenarios
- **Unit 5 Configuration**: Mock risk threshold and methodology configurations
- **Credit Risk System**: Mock traditional credit risk data

## Performance Requirements
- ESG-adjusted risk calculations complete within 1 second per holding
- Risk factor analysis available within 2 seconds of request
- Risk threshold monitoring evaluates all holdings within 10 minutes
- Support concurrent risk calculations for up to 1000 holdings

## Quality Assurance
- ESG-adjusted risk calculations must be mathematically accurate and reproducible
- Risk adjustment factors must be transparent and auditable
- Risk methodology must be documented and version-controlled
- Risk alerts must be accurate with no false positives

## Business Rules

### Linear Risk Adjustment Model
- **Formula**: ESG_Adjusted_Risk = Traditional_Risk × (1 + ESG_Adjustment_Factor)
- **ESG_Adjustment_Factor**: Calculated based on ESG score deviation from benchmark
- **Sector Neutrality**: Same adjustment methodology applied across all sectors
- **Score Mapping**: ESG scores 0-30 increase risk, 70-100 decrease risk, 30-70 neutral

### Risk Factor Contribution Calculation
- **Environmental Impact**: (Environmental_Score - 50) × Environmental_Weight × Risk_Sensitivity
- **Social Impact**: (Social_Score - 50) × Social_Weight × Risk_Sensitivity  
- **Governance Impact**: (Governance_Score - 50) × Governance_Weight × Risk_Sensitivity
- **Total ESG Adjustment**: Sum of all component impacts

### Risk Threshold Logic
- **High Risk**: ESG-adjusted risk score > 80
- **Medium Risk**: ESG-adjusted risk score 50-80
- **Low Risk**: ESG-adjusted risk score < 50
- **Risk Deterioration**: Risk score increase > 15 points triggers alert

## Deployment Considerations
- Requires database for storing risk calculations and history
- Needs integration with external credit risk data sources
- Should include monitoring for risk calculation accuracy
- Requires documentation system for methodology transparency

## Success Criteria
- All 3 user stories fully implemented and tested
- ESG-adjusted risk calculations available via stable API
- Risk factor analysis provides clear ESG contribution breakdown
- Credit risk officers can access transparent risk methodology
- Unit operates independently with clear interfaces to other units

## Risk Management Considerations
- **Model Risk**: Linear adjustment model may not capture complex ESG-risk relationships
- **Data Quality**: Risk calculations depend on quality of both ESG and credit risk data
- **Methodology Changes**: Risk methodology updates require careful version control
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Risk calculations must meet regulatory requirements for transparency
