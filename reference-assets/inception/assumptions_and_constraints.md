41. **Mobile Access**: Mobile application development is out of scope for MVP
42. **Advanced Analytics**: No machine learning or predictive analytics capabilities in MVP
43. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive audit logging is not required for MVP phase

## Data Constraints

### ESG Data Limitations
44. **Data Completeness**: Some ESG metrics may have incomplete coverage across all holdings
45. **Data Lag**: ESG data may have 1-3 month lag from actual performance periods
46. **Methodology Changes**: ESG data provider methodology changes will require system updates
47. **Data Validation**: Manual data validation will be required for critical data quality issues
48. **Benchmark Data**: Peer benchmarking data may have limited sector coverage

### Processing Constraints
49. **Batch Processing**: All data processing will occur in scheduled batch jobs
50. **Error Handling**: Data processing errors will require manual intervention for resolution
51. **Rollback Capability**: Limited ability to rollback data processing in case of errors
52. **Concurrent Updates**: System will not support concurrent data updates from multiple sources
53. **Data Archival**: No automated data archival process for MVP phase

## Regulatory and Compliance Constraints

### ESG Standards Compliance
54. **Framework Alignment**: ESG metrics must align with at least one major framework (GRI, SASB, or TCFD)
55. **Methodology Documentation**: All calculation methodologies must be fully documented
56. **Data Lineage**: Basic data lineage tracking required for regulatory compliance
