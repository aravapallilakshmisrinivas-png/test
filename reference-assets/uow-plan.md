# Unit of Work (UoW) Plan - ESG Data Platform

## Project Overview
Group the 23 user stories from the ESG Data Platform into multiple independent units that can be built by separate teams. Each unit should contain highly cohesive user stories with loose coupling between units.

## Analysis and Planning Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Unit Definition
- [x] **Step 1.1**: Analyze user story dependencies and data flow relationships
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Identify natural cohesion boundaries based on functional domains
- [x] **Step 1.3**: Evaluate coupling between different functional areas
- [x] **Step 1.4**: Define unit boundaries ensuring independence and minimal inter-unit dependencies
- [x] **Step 1.5**: Validate unit definitions against team structure and parallel development feasibility

### Phase 2: Unit Specification and Documentation
- [x] **Step 2.1**: Create /inception/units/ directory structure
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Define Unit 1: Data Processing & ESG Scoring Engine
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Define Unit 2: Portfolio Management & Alerting System
- [x] **Step 2.4**: Define Unit 3: Risk Integration Module
- [x] **Step 2.5**: Define Unit 4: Analytics & Visualization Platform
- [x] **Step 2.6**: Define Unit 5: System Configuration Management

---
**Phase 2 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All 5 units defined and documented
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Unit Documentation Creation

### Phase 3: Unit Documentation Creation
- [x] **Step 3.1**: Create individual .md files for each unit with their respective user stories
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Document acceptance criteria for each user story within their unit context
- [x] **Step 3.3**: Define unit interfaces and integration points
- [x] **Step 3.4**: Document unit dependencies and sequencing requirements
- [x] **Step 3.5**: Create unit overview document with team assignment recommendations

---
**Phase 3 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All unit documentation created
**Next Phase**: Phase 4 - Validation and Finalization

### Phase 4: Validation and Finalization
- [x] **Step 4.1**: Validate unit independence - ensure each unit can be developed separately
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Verify unit cohesion - ensure user stories within each unit are highly related
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Check for missing integration points or overlooked dependencies
- [x] **Step 4.4**: Review unit sizing for appropriate team workload distribution
- [x] **Step 4.5**: Finalize unit documentation and create development handoff materials

---
**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All validation completed successfully
**Overall Plan Status**: ✅ FULLY EXECUTED - Ready for development team handoff

## Preliminary Unit Analysis

### Proposed Unit Structure (Subject to Validation)

**Unit 1: Data Processing & ESG Scoring Engine**
- **Cohesion**: Data ingestion, validation, normalization, and core ESG calculations
- **User Stories**: US-001, US-002, US-003, US-004, US-005, US-006, US-007
- **Team Focus**: Backend data processing and calculation algorithms
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational unit)

**Unit 2: Portfolio Management & Alerting System**
- **Cohesion**: Portfolio monitoring, threshold management, and notification system
- **User Stories**: US-008, US-009, US-010, US-011
- **Team Focus**: Business logic for portfolio analysis and alerting mechanisms
- **Dependencies**: Requires ESG scores from Unit 1

**Unit 3: Risk Integration Module**
- **Cohesion**: ESG-adjusted risk calculations and risk-specific monitoring
- **User Stories**: US-012, US-013, US-014
- **Team Focus**: Risk modeling and integration algorithms
- **Dependencies**: Requires ESG scores from Unit 1

**Unit 4: Analytics & Visualization Platform**
- **Cohesion**: Dashboard interfaces, visualizations, and analytical tools
- **User Stories**: US-015, US-016, US-017, US-018, US-021
- **Team Focus**: Frontend development and data visualization
- **Dependencies**: Requires data from Units 1, 2, and 3

**Unit 5: User Management & System Administration**
- **Cohesion**: Authentication, authorization, role management, and system configuration
- **User Stories**: US-019, US-020, US-022, US-023
- **Team Focus**: Security, user management, and system administration
- **Dependencies**: Foundational for all other units

## Key Considerations Requiring Clarification

### **Step 1.4 - Unit Boundary Decisions**
- **Question 1**: Should ESG Scoring (US-004, US-005, US-006, US-007) be combined with Data Processing (US-001, US-002, US-003) in one unit, or should they be separate units?
  - **Option A**: Combined unit for data-to-score pipeline cohesion
  - **Option B**: Separate units for specialized team focus
  - **Need confirmation on preferred approach**
  [Answer: Combine the units to avoid integration issues]

### **Step 2.6 - Authentication Unit Structure**
- **Question 2**: Should User Authentication (US-022) be a standalone unit or integrated with other units?
  - **Option A**: Standalone security unit with US-019, US-022, US-023
  - **Option B**: Distributed authentication integrated into each functional unit
  - **Need confirmation on security architecture preference**
  [Answer: Should not be built assuming will be integrated with existing authentication and authorization including RBAC instead should use mock data for buidling and testing ]

### **Step 3.3 - Integration Complexity**
- **Question 3**: What level of detail is needed for unit interface definitions?
  - **Option A**: High-level API contracts and data exchange formats
  - **Option B**: Detailed technical specifications with message schemas
  - **Need confirmation on documentation depth required**
  [Answer: Option A]

### **Step 4.4 - Team Sizing**
- **Question 4**: Are there constraints on unit sizing or team composition?
  - **Consideration**: Some units have 3-4 user stories, others have 7 user stories
  - **Need confirmation if unit sizes should be balanced or can vary based on complexity**
  [Answer: No team sizing or story, unit estimation be done. The only criteria of unit definition is Loose Coupling and High Cohesion during development.]

## Success Criteria

### Unit Independence Validation
- [ ] Each unit can be developed by a separate team without blocking others
- [ ] Unit interfaces are clearly defined and stable
- [ ] Integration points are minimal and well-documented
- [ ] Units can be tested independently with mock dependencies

### Unit Cohesion Validation
- [ ] User stories within each unit share common data models
- [ ] User stories within each unit serve the same stakeholder workflows
- [ ] Unit functionality forms a logical, complete feature set
- [ ] Team expertise aligns with unit technical requirements

### Development Feasibility
- [ ] Units can be developed in parallel after foundational units are established
- [ ] Clear sequencing and dependency management between units
- [ ] Integration testing strategy defined for unit interactions
- [ ] Deployment and release strategy accommodates unit-based development

## Risk Mitigation

### Dependency Management Risks
- **Risk**: Circular dependencies between units
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of data flow and clear interface definitions

### Integration Complexity Risks
- **Risk**: Complex integration requirements between units
- **Mitigation**: Define simple, stable APIs and minimize cross-unit communication

### Team Coordination Risks
- **Risk**: Poor coordination between teams working on different units
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and regular integration checkpoints
