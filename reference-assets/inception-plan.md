**Phase 2 Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - All user stories validated and prioritized
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Business Requirements Documentation

### Phase 3: Business Requirements Documentation
- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Document data input specifications (CSV format requirements)
- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Define ESG scoring methodology details (40% Environmental, 30% Social, 30% Governance)
- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Specify threshold-based alerting configuration approach
- [ ] **Step 3.4**: Outline role-based dashboard requirements
- [ ] **Step 3.5**: Define business configuration requirements

### Phase 4: Final Review & Development Handoff Preparation
- [ ] **Step 4.1**: Conduct comprehensive review of all product deliverables
- [ ] **Step 4.2**: Prepare product requirements handoff documentation
- [ ] **Step 4.3**: Create prioritized user story backlog
- [ ] **Step 4.4**: Document any remaining business clarifications needed from stakeholders

## Clarifications Resolved (Based on Global Best Practices)

### **Step 1.2**: Stakeholder Roles and Permissions
**Portfolio Managers**:
- View portfolio-level ESG scores and risk metrics
- Access sector and holding-level drill-down capabilities
- Receive threshold breach alerts for portfolios under management
- Read-only access to scoring methodology documentation

**ESG Analysts**:
- Full access to ESG scoring methodologies and calculations
- View detailed ESG metrics at individual holding level
- Access peer benchmarking and sector comparison tools
- Ability to export ESG data for analysis (CSV format)

**Credit Risk Officers**:
- View ESG-adjusted credit risk calculations
- Access ESG risk factor integration models
- Receive alerts for ESG-related risk threshold breaches
- Access to ESG risk methodology documentation

### **Step 3.2**: ESG Metrics/Indicators by Category (Following GRI, SASB, and TCFD Standards)
**Environmental (40% weighting)**:
- Carbon emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3) - 15%
- Energy efficiency and renewable energy usage - 10%
- Water usage and waste management - 8%
- Biodiversity and environmental impact - 7%

**Social (30% weighting)**:
- Employee diversity and inclusion - 10%
- Health and safety performance - 8%
- Community impact and stakeholder engagement - 7%
- Supply chain labor practices - 5%

**Governance (30% weighting)**:
- Board composition and independence - 12%
- Executive compensation alignment - 8%
- Anti-corruption and ethics policies - 5%
- Transparency and disclosure practices - 5%

### **Step 3.3**: Threshold Values and Alerting Configuration
**ESG Score Thresholds** (0-100 scale):
- Critical: ESG score < 30 (immediate email alert)
- Warning: ESG score 30-50 (daily digest email)
- Watch: ESG score 50-70 (weekly summary email)
- Good: ESG score > 70 (monthly reporting only)

**Portfolio-level Thresholds**:
- Portfolio ESG score drops > 10 points in single update
- More than 25% of holdings below warning threshold
- Any holding falls to critical threshold

**Alerting Frequency**:
- Critical alerts: Immediate email notification
- Warning alerts: Daily digest at 9 AM local time
- Weekly summaries: Monday mornings
- Monthly reports: First business day of month

### **Step 3.4**: Dashboard Visualization and Layout Preferences
**Primary Dashboard Components**:
- ESG Score Gauge Charts (traffic light color coding: Red <30, Yellow 30-70, Green >70)
- Portfolio composition pie charts by ESG rating bands
- Sector-level ESG performance bar charts
- Time-series line charts for ESG score trends (last 12 months)
- Heat maps for ESG risk exposure by sector/geography

**Dashboard Layout Standards**:
- Top-level KPI cards showing portfolio ESG summary metrics
- Interactive drill-down tables with sortable columns
- Responsive design supporting desktop and tablet access
- Export functionality for charts and data tables
- Consistent color scheme following accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Key Assumptions
1. CSV data will be provided in a consistent, standardized format
2. File locations for data input will be pre-configured and stable
3. ESG scoring methodology will use fixed weightings without user customization
4. Email notifications are sufficient for MVP alerting needs
5. Basic linear models are acceptable for ESG-credit risk integration
6. Role-based access will be implemented through simple user role assignment
7. No real-time data processing requirements for MVP
8. Historical data analysis limited to current-state reporting only
9. ESG metrics will follow established global standards (GRI, SASB, TCFD)
10. Dashboard visualizations will follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
11. ESG scoring scale will be normalized to 0-100 for consistency
12. Threshold-based alerting will use industry-standard ESG risk bands
13. User authentication will be handled through existing organizational systems
14. Data refresh frequency will be daily for portfolio updates
15. System will support up to 1000 portfolio holdings for MVP phase

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Predictive analytics and trend forecasting
- Regulatory compliance automation
- External system integrations
- API access capabilities
- Data lineage tracking
- Dynamic data source configuration
- Advanced alerting with configurable rules
- Executive reporting and formal report generation
- Comprehensive audit trails and change tracking
- Advanced risk analytics with sophisticated correlation models
- Strategist role functionality (composite ESG scores for investment ranking, cross-portfolio comparisons)
- Portfolio Analyst role functionality (sector-level performance dashboards, basic analytics)
