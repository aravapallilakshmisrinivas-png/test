## Integration Patterns and Mechanisms

### Primary Integration Patterns

#### 1. Configuration Distribution Pattern
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration management with distributed consumption
**Implementation**:
- Unit 5 serves as single source of truth for all system configuration
- All other units pull configuration data through standardized APIs
- Configuration changes propagated through polling or notification mechanisms
- Configuration versioning and rollback capabilities maintained

**Data Flow**:
```
Unit 5 (Config Store) → Configuration APIs → Units 1, 2, 3, 4
                     ↓
              Configuration Changes → Validation → Distribution
```

#### 2. Data Foundation Pattern
**Purpose**: Centralized ESG data processing with distributed consumption
**Implementation**:
- Unit 1 serves as authoritative source for all ESG scores and data
- Units 2, 3, and 4 consume ESG data through standardized APIs
- Data consistency maintained through versioning and audit trails
- Historical data access supported for trend analysis

**Data Flow**:
```
CSV Files → Unit 1 (Processing) → ESG Scores APIs → Units 2, 3, 4
                               ↓
                        Data Quality Reports → Monitoring
```

#### 3. Business Logic Aggregation Pattern
**Purpose**: Parallel business logic processing with independent scaling
**Implementation**:
- Units 2 and 3 operate independently with no direct dependencies
- Both units consume data from Units 1 and 5 independently
- Unit 4 aggregates results from both units for unified presentation
- Business logic isolation enables independent development and scaling

**Data Flow**:
```
Unit 1 (ESG Data) → Unit 2 (Portfolio Analytics) → Unit 4 (Dashboards)
                 ↓                                ↗
Unit 5 (Config) → Unit 3 (Risk Analytics) ────────┘
```

#### 4. Presentation Aggregation Pattern
**Purpose**: Unified user experience with multi-source data integration
**Implementation**:
- Unit 4 aggregates data from all other units for comprehensive dashboards
- Role-based data filtering and presentation based on user requirements
- Real-time data synchronization and update mechanisms
- Export capabilities spanning all integrated data sources

**Data Flow**:
```
Units 1, 2, 3, 5 → Unit 4 (Data Aggregation) → Role-Based Dashboards
                                            ↓

## Architectural Decision Summary

### Key Integration Decisions

#### API-First Integration Architecture
**Decision**: Use RESTful APIs for all inter-unit communication
**Rationale**: Enables loose coupling, independent development, and system scalability
**Impact**: All units must implement robust API interfaces with comprehensive error handling

#### Pull-Based Data Access Pattern
**Decision**: Implement pull-based data access rather than push-based data distribution
**Rationale**: Simplifies integration architecture and provides better control over data refresh
**Impact**: Units responsible for managing their own data refresh strategies and caching

#### Layered Architecture with Clear Dependencies
**Decision**: Implement layered architecture with clear dependency hierarchy
**Rationale**: Enables independent development and deployment while maintaining system coherence
**Impact**: Foundation units must be deployed before dependent units

#### Eventual Consistency Model
**Decision**: Accept eventual consistency rather than strict consistency across all units
**Rationale**: Enables better performance and availability while meeting business requirements
**Impact**: System design must handle temporary data inconsistencies gracefully

These architectural decisions provide the foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and reliable ESG platform that supports independent unit development while delivering comprehensive integrated functionality.
