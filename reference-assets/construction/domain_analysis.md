- Normalize data to standard scales
- Calculate component ESG scores using defined weightings
- Generate composite ESG scores
- Track data quality and processing status

**Business Rules**:
- ESG scores must be in 0-100 range

- Alert when portfolio score drops >10 points

### Unit 3: Risk Integration
**Key Behaviors**:
- Apply linear adjustment models to integrate ESG with credit risk
- Calculate ESG-adjusted risk scores
- Decompose risk factors by ESG components
- Monitor risk thresholds and generate risk alerts
- Maintain transparency in risk methodology

**Business Rules**:
- Linear adjustment applied uniformly across sectors
- Original credit risk scores must remain accessible

2. **Unit 1 → Units 2, 3, 4**: ESG scores and data
3. **Unit 2 → Unit 4**: Portfolio analytics and alert data
4. **Unit 3 → Unit 4**: Risk analytics and risk data
5. **Unit 5 → Units 2, 3, 4**: Configuration parameters

### Integration Events (Cross-Context)
1. **ESG Score Calculated** (Unit 1 → Units 2, 3, 4)
2. **Portfolio ESG Updated** (Unit 2 → Unit 4)
3. **Risk Calculation Completed** (Unit 3 → Unit 4)
4. **Configuration Changed** (Unit 5 → All Units)
5. **Alert Generated** (Units 2, 3 → Unit 4)

### Anti-Corruption Layer Requirements

## Domain Model Design Principles

### Aggregate Design (Coarse-Grained)
- Focus on consistency boundaries and transaction scopes
- Minimize cross-aggregate dependencies
- Ensure aggregates can be loaded and persisted as units
- Design for performance and scalability

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use domain events for cross-context communication
- Implement eventual consistency between contexts
- Design events for business significance
- Support event sourcing where beneficial

### Repository Patterns
- One repository per aggregate root
- Abstract data access concerns from domain logic
- Support both query and command operations
- Enable testing with in-memory implementations

### Domain Services
- Encapsulate business logic that doesn't belong to entities
- Keep services stateless and focused
- Use for complex calculations and algorithms
- Coordinate between multiple aggregates when needed
