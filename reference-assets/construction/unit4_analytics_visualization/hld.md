### Role-Based Dashboard Framework
**Decision**: Implement role-based dashboard framework rather than single universal dashboard
**Rationale**: Provides targeted user experiences and reduces interface complexity for specific roles
**Trade-offs**: Development complexity vs. user experience optimization and workflow efficiency

### Client-Side Analytics Processing
**Decision**: Perform analytics calculations on client-side rather than server-side processing
**Rationale**: Reduces backend load, improves interactivity, and enables real-time user exploration
**Trade-offs**: Client performance requirements vs. server resource optimization and user experience

### API-First Data Integration
**Decision**: Integrate with backend units through APIs rather than direct database access
