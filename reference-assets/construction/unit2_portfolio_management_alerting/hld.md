### Multi-Tier Alert Threshold Strategy
**Decision**: Implement three-tier alert threshold system (critical, warning, watch)
**Rationale**: Provides appropriate alert granularity and prevents alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues are highlighted
**Trade-offs**: Alert complexity vs. notification effectiveness and user experience

### Real-Time Monitoring with Batch Analytics
**Decision**: Combine real-time threshold monitoring with scheduled batch analytics processing
**Rationale**: Balances immediate alert requirements with comprehensive analytics processing efficiency
