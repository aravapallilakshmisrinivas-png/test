## Deployment Architecture Considerations

### Deployment Independence
- Unit can be deployed independently as foundational service
- No dependencies on other units enable early deployment
- Configuration service must be available before other units start

### Scalability Considerations

- Load balancing for high-availability configuration access
- Caching strategies to reduce configuration service load

### Operational Requirements
- Secure file system access for configuration files
- Database or persistent storage for configuration history
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure for service health

## Risk Mitigation Architecture

### Configuration Failure Scenarios
- **File System Unavailability**: Cached configuration data provides temporary service continuity
- **Configuration Validation Failures**: Previous valid configuration maintained until issues resolved
- **API Service Failures**: Redundant configuration service instances provide failover

### Data Integrity Protection
- **Configuration Backup**: Regular backup of configuration data and history
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Multiple validation stages prevent invalid configuration deployment
- **Change Approval**: Configuration change approval workflows for critical parameters

## Success Criteria and Validation

### Functional Success Criteria
- All system configuration managed through centralized file-based system
- Configuration changes propagated to all dependent units within defined timeframes
- Configuration validation prevents invalid system states
- Configuration history and audit trail maintained for compliance

### Non-Functional Success Criteria
- Configuration API response times meet performance requirements
- High availability maintained through redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Security requirements met for configuration access and storage
- Operational procedures enable efficient configuration management

### Integration Success Criteria
- All other units successfully consume configuration through provided APIs
- Configuration changes coordinated across all dependent units
- System behavior adapts to configuration changes without code deployment
- Configuration-driven system flexibility demonstrated across all operational scenarios

## Architectural Decision Rationale

### File-Based Configuration Choice
**Decision**: Use file-based configuration with API distribution
**Rationale**: Provides operational flexibility, version control integration, and human-readable configuration management
**Trade-offs**: File system dependency vs. operational simplicity and transparency

### Pull-Based Configuration Access
**Decision**: Dependent units pull configuration data rather than push-based distribution
**Rationale**: Simplifies configuration service design and provides better control over configuration refresh timing
**Trade-offs**: Potential configuration lag vs. system simplicity and reliability

### Centralized Configuration Management
**Decision**: Single configuration service for all units rather than distributed configuration
**Rationale**: Ensures configuration consistency, simplifies management, and provides single source of truth
**Trade-offs**: Single point of failure vs. consistency and operational simplicity
